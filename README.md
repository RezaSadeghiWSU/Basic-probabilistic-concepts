1. posterior probability: The posterior probability is the probability of the parameters {\displaystyle \theta } \theta  given the evidence {\displaystyle X} X: {\displaystyle p(\theta |X)} p(\theta |X)

2. likelihood function: The likelihood function, which is the probability of the evidence given the parameters: {\displaystyle p(X|\theta )} p(X|\theta )

3. prior belief:  A prior belief (the probability distribution function) is {\displaystyle p(\theta )} p(\theta )
